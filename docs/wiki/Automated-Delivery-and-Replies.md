# Automated Delivery and Replies Guide

[中文](自动化发货与回复.zh-CN) | English

## Four automation triggers

| Trigger | When it runs | Standard flow |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Price change for unpaid order | A buyer’s unpaid order card arrives | Match product/specification → change to target price → optionally send a reminder. |
| Paid delivery | A payment system card arrives | Match product/specification → send cards → confirm shipment after success. |
| Review gift | A review system card arrives | Match product/specification → send gift cards. |
| Review reminder | A scheduled scan finds a shipped, unreviewed order | Wait until the threshold → send the reminder copy. |

System notification cards enter automation decisions only. In the current production wiring, ordinary buyer messages go through keyword replies, AI replies, and default replies in that order; the code retains an extension point for an external API reply handler.

Payment reminders, successful bargaining cards awaiting shipment, and review reminders can use different system-message formats. The system recognizes their transaction semantics. Ordinary buyer chat does not trigger transaction automation. Result notifications are sent when the account has a bound channel whose event filters include Transaction Notifications, and the automation reaches completed, failed, or manual-review status.

Account-level automatic reviews and daily refresh are separate from the order rules above. Configure them under Account Management → Automatic Reviews and Daily Refresh; see [Chat and Account Automation](Chat-and-Account-Automation).

## Configure unpaid-order price changes

1. Create an Unpaid Order Price Change rule, select the account and product/specification, and enter the target price.
2. Optionally enter reminder text to send after a successful change; blank means only change the price.
3. Save and enable the rule. It applies only before payment. Paid or closed orders and platform-rejected changes are recorded as failures.

## Configure paid delivery

Prerequisites: the account is online, the product is synced, and an enabled card group has sufficient inventory.

1. Open Automation, choose Paid Delivery, and click Add.
2. Set a rule name and select the target account and product. For products with specifications, create a matching configuration for each specification that needs delivery.
3. Add a Send Cards action, choose card inventory, set quantity per item, and choose whether the action is enabled.
4. To override the card group’s default delay, enable the override and enter seconds; otherwise the group delay is used.
5. Save and confirm the rule is enabled.
6. Use a test order to verify card content is sent, inventory is deducted correctly, and shipment is confirmed only afterward.

For result notifications, bind a notification channel to the account and enable Transaction Notifications in the channel’s events. Quantity per item is multiplied by the order quantity; do not enter the per-order total as the per-item quantity.

## Configure review gifts and reminders

Review gifts use the same configuration pattern as paid delivery, with Review Gift as the trigger. Use a separate card group for gifts so inventory and replenishment remain easy to audit.

To configure review reminders:

1. Create a Review Reminder rule and select account and product.
2. Set how many hours after shipment to wait, the repeat interval, and the maximum number of reminders.
3. Enter the copy, save, and enable the rule.
4. Use a test order to confirm that no message is sent early and that reminders stop at the maximum.

## Exceptions and manual delivery

The exception area of Automation lists actionable runs and delayed tasks. Check the order, inventory, chat history, and failure reason before using Process/Resolve. If delivery status is uncertain, do not retry immediately; duplicate cards may be sent.

For a manual resend, locate the order in Orders, confirm buyer, product, and delivery history, then use manual delivery/resend. Record the reason and check inventory afterward.

## Keyword and default replies

In Automation → Keyword Replies, select an account, add a rule, enter keywords and text or image URL, and save. Keyword rules apply to ordinary buyer messages.

Default replies are the last level of the current production chain: keyword reply first, AI reply second, and default reply last. AI handles bargaining only. If AI is disabled, lacks an API key, does not apply to the message, has no usable result, or fails, the system continues to the default reply. A default reply may contain text, an image URL, and “reply only once per conversation”. A product-specific default reply takes precedence over the account default. The external API extension point, if later wired, takes precedence over keyword replies.
